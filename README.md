# Project Title

Angelo Rocky Dibello - Portfolio


## Description 

This project is a simple Portfolio built with three html pages. The first page "Home" is the heart of this portfolio.
The "Home" page includes a navbar where is possibile to navigate through the portfolio and its links. It's the main page of the website
and has a Bio section called "About me". I've used a very clear font to make sure it's clean and readable. I've choosen the courier font
to write the description of "About me" because based on the "fictional/comic book" style of this website I think it was a good match.
To create this page first of all I've picked a futurist background image which I've place inside the html body. After doing so I wanted to
create a container to have the main box where my "AboutMe/Bio" would be placed. When we move  to the "Portfolio" page using the navbar here we have 
all my work that I've done has web developer. The "Portfolio" section has a navbar has well so you are able to navigate through the website anytime no matter 
what page you're in. I've done the same for the "Contact" page. The "Contact" page is a very simple box where you can submit your name, your email 
and send me a message so we are able to keep in touch for any sort of future collaboration! I've also put my GitHub link, my LinkedIn link and 
an icon link to be able to download my resume.
