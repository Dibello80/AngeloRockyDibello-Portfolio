        Hi there, I'm Angelo Rocky Dibello. 
        I am an up and coming web developer, currently in the UCLA Extension Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp (2020/21).
        I've been a computer lover since I can remember. Starting from a passion for videogames I've seen through my eyes the incredible
        evolution of the "species" like Charles Darwin would probably say! I've owned my first Atari console, Commodore 64, Nintendo, Amiga 500 and 600,
        PS1, PS2, PSP, PS3 and PS4. During my High School years in Italy I bought my first PC and if I'm not mistaken it was runnig by Windows 95. I purchased my
        first computer because my major course of study was Computers, Circuit Boards, CPU, Telecommunication Arts and Technology in Monopoli (BA), South Italy. 
        I've graduated in 1999. After that I've decide to pursue a Music career and I've earned my Music Performance Major in Milan, Italy in 2004. 
        I've been playing Guitars and Drums for more than 27 years studying with incredible musicians like Chad Wackerman (Frank Zappa drummer) and Luca Colombo (Eros Ramazzotti guitarist).
        I've produced music and music soundtracks for Dolce & Gabbana for 3 years. I've been using Pro Tools software to produce my music since I was 19 years old.
        I was also able to take a Adobe Photoshop class in Milan during my music college years and that was definetely a great choice to add another very usefull skill to build and create websites.
        Being a visual person the look and the design of my websites is very important to me. I consider my style a mix between modern, comic books and futurist combo. Despite that I love vintage stuff like vinyls, clothes or vintage guitars!
        Endless possibilities is my motto! I love the challenge and I like to push my self to the limit. I'm currently working on two apps I've created. One of this app it's called "Buddy" and is available in its <meta name="owner" content="">
        basic version on my portfolio section and also on my github. I'm very excited about this new journey as Full-Stack as Web Developer and I'm looking forward to work on new projects 
        in the fabulous world of Web Development! Enjoy the ride!
